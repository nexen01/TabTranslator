Hello! 

Welcome to my Tab Translator Project! I made this in October 2017. 
Before using this program, copy-paste a guitar tab into input.txt. 
To use this program, open up command prompt or some equivilent. Use command "cd" to go to the folder into which the file is. Make sure all supporting files are also there. Type "java -jar TabTranslator.jar". The program will then run without any further need for input. 
The program is configured to output the tab input.txt into output.txt, only in Drop-C tuining. 

Thank you for taking the time to review my programs I made while in high school for no direct benefit.
